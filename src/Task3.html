            3) Read a text file containing a set of flat polygons represented as one polygon per line.<br>
     Each line contains a comma-separated list of side lengths (for example “3,4,8,5,7”). <br>
     Write a function to classify the set of polygons into four mutually exclusive subsets: triangles, rectangles, squares, and everything else. <br>
     The union of all four subsets should be the original set of polygons. <br>
     All the sides of the polygons are connected and the angles between them are irrelevant.<br>
     Only consider the lengths.
